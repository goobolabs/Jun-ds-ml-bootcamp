#  StockSense AI

## Intelligent Inventory Management and Stockout Prediction System

**StockSense AI** is a full-stack machine learning application developed as the final capstone project for the Goobo Labs Data Science & Machine Learning Bootcamp.

The system helps businesses manage inventory more efficiently by combining **K-Means Clustering** and **Machine Learning Classification** to categorize inventory and predict stockout risks before they occur.

---

## Project Overview

StockSense AI performs two main tasks:

###  Inventory Categorization

The system uses **K-Means Clustering** to automatically classify inventory into:

-  Fast Moving
-  Medium Moving
-  Slow Moving

This helps businesses understand product movement patterns and improve inventory planning.

---

###  Stockout Prediction

The system predicts whether a product is at risk of running out of stock using multiple machine learning algorithms.

Algorithms trained:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

The best-performing model is saved as **best_model.pkl** and used during prediction.
